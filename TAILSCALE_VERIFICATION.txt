  [⏳] VPS reachability pending - Awaiting both systems authorized

================================================================================
IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS
================================================================================

PRIORITY 1 - Complete Authentication (Do This Now):

  Option A - GUI Method (Recommended):
    1. Open /Applications/Tailscale.app
    2. Click menu icon in top-right corner
    3. Select "Authenticate" or "Sign in"
    4. Complete login in browser window that opens

  Option B - CLI Method:
    1. Run: /opt/homebrew/bin/tailscale up
    2. Copy authentication URL from output
    3. Open URL in browser
    4. Complete login

PRIORITY 2 - Verify Connection (After Authentication):
    Run: tailscale status
    Expected: Should see your Mac listed with "active" status
    
PRIORITY 3 - Get Your IP Address:
    Run: tailscale ip -4
    Expected: IP in format 100.x.x.x
    Save this IP for reference

PRIORITY 4 - Wait for VPS:
    VPS must be authorized separately at:
    https://login.tailscale.com/a/11d856a9014064

PRIORITY 5 - Test Connection (Once VPS is Online):
    Run: ssh root@100.y.y.y (VPS Tailscale IP)

DREAMNOVA TAILNET CONFIGURATION
================================================================================

Tailnet Name: DreamNova Cluster Mesh
Purpose: Private encrypted mesh network
Join URL: https://login.tailscale.com/a/11d856a9014064

Members:
  [✓] This Mac (Ready to join)
  [⏳] DreamNova VPS (Awaiting authorization)

Network Type: Private, encrypted, point-to-point mesh
Encryption: AES-256, WireGuard protocol
Authentication: OAuth-based

================================================================================
EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER AUTHENTICATION
================================================================================

After you complete authentication, you should see:

1. In Tailscale GUI:
   - Connected indicator showing green/active
   - Your machine listed in the network
   - IP address assigned

2. Running 'tailscale status':
   100.64.x.x    your-mac      active    [region]
   [VPS entry will appear once it's authorized]

3. Running 'tailscale ip -4':
   100.64.x.x

4. Connectivity test:
   ping 100.64.x.x (should respond with your own IP)

================================================================================
VPS CONNECTION PROCEDURE (When Both Are Authorized)
================================================================================

Once both this Mac and VPS complete authentication:

1. Check mesh status:
   tailscale status

   Expected output:
   100.64.x.x    your-mac      active    (this Mac)
   100.64.y.y    vps-name      active    (the VPS)

2. Test connectivity:
   ping 100.64.y.y
   (should respond successfully)

3. SSH to VPS:
   ssh root@100.64.y.y

4. Verify two-way connection:
   - SSH should work
   - Latency should be very low (usually < 50ms)
   - Connection is encrypted end-to-end

Issue: Authentication URL not appearing
  → Ensure GUI is running: open /Applications/Tailscale.app
  → Check firewall isn't blocking Tailscale

Issue: Can't SSH to VPS
  → Verify both machines in mesh: tailscale status
  → Check VPS status is "active"
  → Test ping first: ping 100.y.y.y

Issue: Slow connection
  → Check network: tailscale netcheck
  → Verify no firewall blocking UDP
  → Check both systems have active connection

================================================================================
